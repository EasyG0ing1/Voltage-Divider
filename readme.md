# Voltage Divider

This program makes it easy to calculate any value in the standard voltage divider equation.

Simply click on a resistor or any of the voltage points and when you set any three of the four values, you can calculate the fourth value.

Easily find resistor values to attain a desired output voltage.

Once the equation has been calculated, it posts the result and accumulates a log of all your calculations. The log also includes the voltage across each resistor for convenience.

There is a menu at the upper right of the window. When you hover over it, it lights up and it lets you either clear all of the values, copy the entire log of RAW values to your clipboard in CSV format so that you can paste them into a spreadsheet for further analysis (including header row), or exit the program.

The output values are rounded, voltages to three decimals and resistors to two, but it uses the un-rounded values for calculations.

It's a simple but useful app.

Maven will be able to import all of the necessary libraries, and I included a custom library that I wrote in the root folder that you can import before you run the project. It's called CustomControls.jar
